## What is MITRE ATT&CK?
MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge) is a globally recognized knowledge base that documents real-world adversary behavior.  
It explains *how attackers operate*—from initial access to data theft—using a standardized, structured model.

ATT&CK is not a tool; it is a framework used to understand, analyze, and classify cyberattacks across the entire intrusion lifecycle.

## Why Does MITRE ATT&CK Exist?
MITRE ATT&CK exists to create a **common language** for describing cyberattacks and adversary behavior. Before ATT&CK, organizations used inconsistent models, making detection, investigation, and reporting difficult.

ATT&CK solves this by providing:

- A universal vocabulary for cyberattacks  
- A consistent model for identifying adversary actions  
- A global library of real-world techniques  
- A foundation for detection engineering, threat hunting, and incident response  

In essence, ATT&CK exists so cyber defenders, analysts, red teamers, and researchers can communicate effectively.
